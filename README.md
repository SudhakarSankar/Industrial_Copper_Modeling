# Industrial_Copper_Modeling


ðŸ“Œ Copper Industry Price Prediction & Lead Classification

ðŸ“– Overview
This project develops machine learning models to predict selling prices of copper products and classify lead status (Won/Lost). The analysis addresses skewness, outliers, and noisy data, enabling better decision-making in pricing and sales strategies.

ðŸ“Š Key Features
âœ” Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, outliers, and formatted dataset.
âœ” Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized pricing trends, outliers, and feature distributions.
âœ” Feature Engineering: Applied encoding techniques, transformed skewed data, and removed highly correlated features.
âœ” Machine Learning Models:
Â Â Â Â  ðŸ”¹ Regression: Predicted Selling_Price using Extra Trees & XGBoost.
Â Â Â Â  ðŸ”¹ Classification: Predicted Status (Won/Lost) using ExtraTreesClassifier & Logistic Regression.
âœ” Model Deployment: Built a Streamlit app for interactive predictions.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
ðŸŸ¢ Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
ðŸŸ¢ Scikit-learn & XGBoost (Machine Learning)
ðŸŸ¢ Streamlit (Model Deployment)
ðŸŸ¢ Pickle (Model Storage)

ðŸ“Š Key Insights
ðŸ“Œ Pricing Factors: Selling price is influenced by material type, thickness, and quantity.
ðŸ“Œ Lead Conversion: Successful deals depend on customer segment, order quantity, and region.
ðŸ“Œ Model Accuracy: Regression and classification models effectively reduce prediction errors.

ðŸš€ Future Improvements
âœ” Implement deep learning models for better accuracy.
âœ” Enhance feature engineering with industry-specific insights.
âœ” Deploy as a web service using Flask/FastAPI for broader usability.
